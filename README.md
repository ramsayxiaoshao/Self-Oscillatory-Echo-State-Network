# Self-Oscillatory-Echo-State-Network
A PyTorch version of the Self-Oscillatory Echo State Network (SO-ESN). SO-ESN generates oscillations to reproduce desired waveforms. The reproduced waveforms are identical to reproducing CPG motor patterns, which can be applied to the actuators of a robotic system to create rhythmic movement.
